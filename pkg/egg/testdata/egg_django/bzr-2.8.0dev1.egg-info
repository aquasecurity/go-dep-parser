        README for Bazaar
        =================
        
        Bazaar (``bzr``) is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be
        easy for developers and end users alike.  Bazaar is part of the GNU project to
        develop a complete free operating system <http://www.gnu.org/>, and a project
        of Canonical <http://www.canonical.com/>.
        
        Ready-to-install packages are available for most popular operating systems from
        <http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Download/> or you can install from source by
        following the instructions in the INSTALL file.
        
        To learn how to use Bazaar, see the official documentation in the `doc`
        directory or at <http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/en/>.

        Bazaar highlights
        =================
        
        Bazaar directly supports both central version control (like cvs/svn) and
        distributed version control (like git/hg). Developers can organize their
        workspace in whichever way they want on a per project basis including:
        
        * checkouts (like svn)
        * feature branches (like hg)
        * shared working tree (like git).
        
        It also directly supports and encourages a large number of development best
        practices like refactoring and pre-commit regression testing. Users can
        choose between our command line tool and our cross-platform GUI application.
